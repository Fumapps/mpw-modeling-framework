# Architecture Review 2021-02

* for master thesis _Redesigning the Hamster Simulation_
* proposal can be found in the _Colloquium Software Quality and Architecture_ ILIAS course, in the folder `2020-MastersThesisProposal-Fuksa-Hamstersimulator` (https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_fold_2092546.html)
* further information in the GitHub Wiki
    * architecture (https://github.com/Fumapps/mpw-modeling-framework/wiki/Architecture)

Note: This time, the review focuses on a tutorial, which is used to extend the hamster-simulator by new commands and queries for a new "Breadcrumb" entity.

## Follow the tutorial

As described in the GitHub Tutorial.md (https://github.com/Fumapps/mpw-modeling-hamster/blob/master/tutorial/Tutorial.md):

* setup Eclipse (this time, it is easier than in the last review)
* create the Breadcrumb entity, model two commands for pick and put breadcrumbs and add a breadcrumbAvailable query.
* extend the graphical Java UI simulator and test the extension

## Further documentation

* in the mpw-modeling-framework Wiki (https://github.com/Fumapps/mpw-modeling-framework/wiki), some design and architecture documentation can be read on demand

## Other sources

* the MPW Modeling Framework (https://github.com/Fumapps/mpw-modeling-framework)
* on interest, the C++ hamster-simulator can be extended analog to the Java simulator
    * simply repeat the presenter / UI related steps for C++
* there is also a kara simulator (https://github.com/Fumapps/mpw-modeling-kara)
    * note: only the Java code is fully implemented
